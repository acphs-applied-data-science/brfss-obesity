# Goals:

- Tell a story with data.
- Discuss how social science is different.

# Let the data speak!

- Introductory data classes tend to focus on "mechanics".
  - You have to start <span style = "color:green; font-style:italic;">somewhere . . . </span>
  - Examples:
    - Calculate the average.
    - Count the number of things per group (stratification).
    - Build a specific model, `y ~ x`.
- Storytelling:
  - Humans do this naturally.
  - Yet, usually causes <span style="color:dodgerblue">students to freeze up</span>.
  - This can be a powerful way to let the data speak.
  - <span style = "color:red">CAUTION!!!</span>



# BRFSS

- Data: Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS)
  - Annual survey run by the CDC which began in 1994.
  - Administered by state health departments
  - State health departments can add questions.
  - Focus: car safety, obesity, exercise, etc.
  - It is based on a SAMPLE of people in the state.
  - Methodology allows for us to make meaningful statements about subgroups.
    - AKA: stratification(s)
    - Today's story is based on all adult answers.
  - All answers are "self report".



# Questions in our data

There are many, many more questions on the BRFSS.
<small>

- **Weight Status:**
  - <span style = "color:dodgerblue">`obese:` Percent of adults aged 18 years and older who have obesity.</span>
  - `overweight:` Percent of adults aged 18 years and older who have an overweight classification.
- **Behavior:**
  - `no_fruits:` Percent of adults who report consuming fruit less than one time daily.
  - `no_vegetables:` Percent of adults who report consuming vegetables less than one time daily.
- **Physical Activity:**
  - `exercise_150:` Percent of adults who achieve at least 150 minutes a week of moderate-intensity aerobic physical activity or 75 minutes a week of vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity and engage in muscle-strengthening activities on 2 or more days a week.
  - `exercise_300:` Percent of adults who achieve at least 300 minutes a week of moderate-intensity aerobic physical activity or 150 minutes a week of vigorous-intensity aerobic activity (or an equivalent combination).
  - `muscle_strengthening:` Percent of adults who engage in muscle-strengthening activities on 2 or more days a week.
  - `exercise_150_muscle_strengthening:` Percent of adults who achieve at least 150 minutes a week of moderate-intensity aerobic physical activity or 75 minutes a week of vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity and engage in muscle-strengthening activities on 2 or more days a week.
  - <span style = "color:dodgerblue">`no_physical_activity:` Percent of adults who engage in no leisure-time physical activity.</span>

# Our story:

<small>

- **Question:** At the state-population level, what is the relationship between the percentage of the population which does not exercise and the percentage of the population which is obese?
- **Answer:** Lack of exercise is a risk factor for obesity at the individual and population level.
  - States with higher levels of self-reported lack of exercise also have higher levels of self-reported obesity.
  - Although the relationship might not be as simple as you might think.
  - Modeling human behavior/outcomes is hard.

- Note: The 51st "state" is the District of Columbia.
